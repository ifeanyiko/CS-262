1b.)//What do the export commands do?

 Export Default is used to export only one value from a file which can be a class, function, or object.

1c.)//This application uses stack navigation. What does the stack do here? What is the deepest this stack can get in this application?

The About page is the deepest the stack can go in this application. Stack allows the user to backtrack the exact pages that were visited.
