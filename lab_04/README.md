This lab is based on [This](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started).

1a.) The NavigationContainer construct is used to implement separate pages of an application.

1b.) The React Navigation native stack navigator is conceptually similar to the URL/URI.

1c.) No it doesn't because the arrow function has to refer to the other function.

2a.) The FlatList component from React creates a list using the data we made in the list tiled "reviews".

2b.) route.params allows us to access the different pieces of the database made in the Homescree function.
